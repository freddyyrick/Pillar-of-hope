🌙 Story / Narrative

Once a quiet and peaceful village, Aldenheim now trembles under the shadow of fear.
On a cold night, creepy creatures emerged from the forest — twisted, shapeless beings that devour everything in their path. Villagers whisper of an ancient curse reawakened.

But amidst the terror, one man rises. A lone swordsman, forged by loss and fire, steps forward to protect the last light of humanity. With nothing but a blade, courage, and the will to survive, he will cut through the darkness and reclaim the land.
