PILLAR OF HOPE
 “When darkness falls, only the blade can bring back the light.”
A fast-paced 2D action hack-and-slash game where a lone swordsman battles twisted creatures to rescue his village and uncover the truth about an ancient curse.

**🌙 1. Story / Narrative**
The peaceful village of Aldenheim is plunged into terror when horrifying, shapeless creatures emerge from the dark forest on a cold night. These beings, born from a reawakened ancient curse, devour everything in their path. In the chaos, many villagers,  including the protagonist’s family, are taken.
From this tragedy rises one man:
A villager turned swordsman, forged by loss and desperation. With no magic, no armor, and no allies, he becomes the last beacon of hope.
His mission is simple yet deadly: Hunt. Slash. Survive.
He must cut through the horrors, rescue his people, and destroy the evil lurking deep within the cursed forest.
